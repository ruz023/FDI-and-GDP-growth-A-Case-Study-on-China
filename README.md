# FDI-and-GDP-growth-A-Case-Study-on-China
 
In this project, I built and evaluated a linear regression model to predict China's overall GDP growth based on the FDI(Foreign Direct Investment) it receives. 
The evaluation includes checking for the model's function form(to see if any transformation of predictor variables are necessary), potential omitted variable bias, 
and eliminating possibilities of bias arising from multicollinearity, serial correlation, and heteroskedasticity.
